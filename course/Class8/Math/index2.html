            <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p><strong><u>Introduction to Linear Equations</u></strong></p>
                <p>A <strong>linear equation</strong> is an algebraic equation in which each term is either a constant or the product of a constant and a variable. This variable is always single power form. A simple example of a linear equation with only one variable, x, may be written in the form: ax + b = 0, where a and b are constants and a &ne; 0.</p>
                <p>These equations are called <strong>Linear Equations in one variable</strong>. Examples:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>2x</li>
                <li>5/4 (x-4)</li>
                <li>3y-7</li>
                <li>x<sup>2</sup> + 1 is an non-linear as the variable has power more than 1.</li>
                <li>5xy + 10 is not a linear equation in one variable as there are two variables</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For example, if a child has 2 chocolates of 10 rupees and a 20 rupee note, the total value can be calculated using the equation 2x + 20 = 2 * 10 + 20 = 40. Here &lsquo;x&rsquo; is variable and is the value of the chocolate.</p>

                <p>Another example, one child buys three toys (costing rupees 20 each) from a shopkeeper but gives only 5 rupees to him. The total value of items with child will be 3y - 5, where y is the cost of one toy.</p>

            <h3>Algebraic Equations and Solutions</h3>
                <p><strong><u>Algebraic Equations and Solutions</u></strong></p>
                <p>An <strong>algebraic equation</strong> is an equality involving variables. The expression on the left of equality is called <strong>LHS (Left Hand Side)</strong> and on the right is called <strong>RHS (Right Hand Side)</strong>.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>From the above example, an algebraic equation is 2x + 20 = 40, where x is variable. Here 2x + 20 is LHS and 40 is RHS.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A <strong>Solution</strong> is the true value of the variables in the algebraic equations for which the equation holds true and LHS is equal to RHS.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>From the above example, algebraic equation is 2x + 20 = 40.
                <ul>
                <li>For x = 10, 2 * 10 + 20 = 40. Or, 40 = 40. Since LHS = RHS, hence x = 10 is the solution.</li>
                <li>For x = 5, 2 * 5 + 20 = 40.Or, 30 = 40. Since LHS &ne; RHS, hence x = 5 is not the solution.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Solving Equations</h3>
            <p><strong><u>Solving Equations having linear expression/equation on one side and number on the other</u></strong></p>
            <p>There are various methods to solve the algebraic equations:</p>
            <p><strong>1. By addition/subtraction and multiplication/division</strong></p>
            <p>Example, an algebraic equation is 2x - 3 = 7</p>
            <p>Adding 3 both sides, 2x - 3 + 3 = 7 + 3 or 2x = 10</p>
            <p>Dividing both sides by 2, 2x/2 = 10/2 or <strong>x = 5</strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>2. By transposing</strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;Example, an algebraic equation is x - 3 = 7</p>
            <p>Transposing 3 to RHS, x = 7 + 3 or <strong>x = 10</strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>3. Using combination of above 2 methods</strong></p>
            <p>Example, an algebraic equation is x/3 + 5/2 = -3/2</p>
            <p>Transposing 5/2 to RHS, x/3 = -3/2- 5/2 or x/3= -8/2 or x/3 = -4</p>
            <p>Multiplying both sides by 3, x/3 * 3 = -4 * 3 or <strong>x = -12</strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <h3>Solving Equations having variables on both sides</h3>
            <p><strong><u>Solving Equations having variables on both sides</u></strong></p>
            <p>The equations having variables in both sides are solved similar to the above.</p>
            <p><em><strong>Example</strong></em>, an equation is 2x - 3 = x + 2</p>
            <p>Adding 3 both sides, 2x - 3 + 3 = x + 2 + 3 or 2x = x + 5</p>
            <p>Subtracting x from both sides, 2x - x = x + 5 - x or <strong>x = 5</strong></p>

            <h3>Reducing equations to simpler form</h3>
            <p><strong><u>Reducing equations to simpler form</u></strong></p>
            <p>Equations can be reduced to simpler form by</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Removing the denominators of both the sides.</li>
            <li>Opening the brackets.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Example, an equation is (6x + 1)/3 + 1 = (x - 3)/6</p>
            <p><strong>Removing the denominators</strong> by multiplying both sides by 6 because it is the LCM of the denominators of both sides,</p>
            <p>6*(6x + 1)/3) + 1*6 = ((x - 3)/6)*6</p>
            <ul>
            <li>2(6x + 1) + 6 = x - 3</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Opening the brackets</strong>,</p>
            <ul>
            <li>12x + 2 + 6 = x - 3</li>
            <li>12x + 8 = x - 3</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Adding 3 both sides,</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
            <li>12x + 8 + 3 = x - 3 + 3</li>
            <li>12x + 11 = x</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Transposing 11 to RHS and x to LHS,</p>
            <ul>
            <li>12x - x = -11</li>
            <li>11x = -11</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Dividing both sides by 11,</p>
            <ul>
            <li>x = -1</li>
            <li>Cross-Multiplication</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Example, an equation is (x + 1)/(2x + 3) = 3/8</p>
            <p><strong>By cross-multiplication,</strong>the denominator of LHS gets multiplied with numerator of RHS and vice-versa,</p>
            <p>So, 8 * (x + 1) = 3 * (2x + 3)</p>
            <ul>
            <li>8x + 8 = 6x + 9 (opening the brackets)</li>
            <li>8x - 6x = 9 - 8 (transposing 6x and 8 other sides)</li>
            <li>2x = 1</li>
            <li>x = 1/2 (Dividing both sides by 2)</li>
            </ul>
