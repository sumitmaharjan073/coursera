    <p>Friction is a type of forces that <strong>opposes motion</strong>. It is that forces which always acts in a direction <strong>opposite to that of the applied force</strong>. In case of a ball freely rolling on the ground, the ball eventually comes to stop, because of the force of friction that acts between the ball and the ground. When the rowing of a boat is stopped, the boat eventually comes to a halt because of friction. It also means that while rowing the force should be greater than the force of friction.</p>

<p>&nbsp;If force acts from right to left (&lt;--), friction acts in left to right direction (--&gt;) (See boat example)<br> If force acts from left to right (--&gt;), friction acts in right to left direction (&lt;--). (See football example)</p>
