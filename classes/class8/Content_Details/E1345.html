    <p><strong><u>Electroplating</u></strong></p>
<p>We have seen many times wherein artificial jewellery is shining when it is new and after sometime it begins to lose its shine. Same case with bicycle handle bars, nuts, bolts etc. This is because these metals are coated with another metal to give it their lustrous appearance and still keep it cost effective.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Experiment</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Take <strong>distilled water in a beaker</strong> and dissolve some <strong>copper sulphate</strong> in it. Add a few drops of <strong>dilute sulphuric acid</strong> to it to make it more conducting.</li>
<li>Take <strong>2 clean copper plates</strong>. (Clean it with sandpaper, then rinse them with water and dry them)</li>
<li>Connect the copper plates to the <strong>terminals of the battery.</strong></li>
<li>Immerse them in the copper sulphate solution.</li>
<li>Allow the current to pass through the circuit for 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Remove the electrodes and observe them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Observation</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The plate connected to the <strong>positive terminal</strong> looks <strong>corroded</strong>.</li>
<li>The plate connected to the <strong>negative terminal</strong> has a thin <strong>layer of metal</strong> on its surface.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Analysis</u></strong></p>
<p>The above changes are seen due to the <strong>Chemical Effects of Electric Current</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>When <strong>electric current</strong> passes through the <strong>copper sulphate solution</strong>, the copper sulphate dissociates into <strong>copper and sulphate</strong>.</li>
<li>The free <strong>copper</strong> gets attracted towards the <strong>negative terminal</strong> and is <strong>deposited</strong> on the <strong>plate</strong> connected to the <strong>negative terminal</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>copper</strong> present in the <strong>copper plate</strong> which is connected to the <strong>positive terminal</strong> gets <strong>dissolved</strong> in the copper sulphate solution, thus replacing the loss of copper from the solution.</li>
<li>And this process continues.</li>
</ul>
<p>This process is called <strong>Electroplating</strong></p>
