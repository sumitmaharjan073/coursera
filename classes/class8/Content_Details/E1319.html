        <h3> Pressure exerted by Liquids and Gases</h3>
    <p><strong>Force acting on unit area is called Pressure ie Pressure =&nbsp;&nbsp; Force/Area</strong></p>
<p>This explains why it is easier to hammer a nail into the wall. It is because we apply a greater amount of force into a very small area of the screw head. Going by the above equation, the force is large and the area is small. So, the pressure is very high.&nbsp; There are instances when you also can feel pressure - when you are having a body massage. When a person massages your body with his hands, the force applied is very high on a relatively small area of his hand. The pressure is high and there is bearable but curative pain and pressure that you feel.</p>

        <p>Liquids also exert pressure in <strong>all directions</strong> on the walls of the container they are stored in. We see water coming out from leaking pipes and taps. In case of a bath shower and fountain, water comes out tiny holes.</p>

<p>Gases (Air) also exert pressure in <strong>all directions</strong>. When you make a hole on a fully inflated balloon, then does the balloon not break, thereby releasing all the air from inside.</p>
<p>Atmosphere (which means the air all around us) also exerts pressure. This is known <strong>as Atmospheric&nbsp; Pressure.</strong> The value of atmospheric pressure is very high.</p>
