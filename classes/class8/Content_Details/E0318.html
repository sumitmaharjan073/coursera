    <p><strong><u>Rational numbers between two rational numbers</u></strong></p>
    <p>There are always definite amount of numbers between two natural/whole numbers or integers. But, there can be <strong>indefinite</strong> amount of numbers between two rational numbers.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Natural numbers between 4 and 22 are 17 (5, 6, &hellip;, 20, 21).</li>
    <li>Whole numbers between 0 and 5 are 4 (1,2,3 and 4).</li>
    <li>Integers between -4 and 9 are 12 (-3, -2, &hellip;., 7, 8)</li>
    <li>Rational numbers between 3/10 and 7/10 can be:
    <ul>
    <li>4/10, 5/10, 6/10</li>
    <li>Or, 31/100, 32/100, &hellip;., 68/100, 69/100 since 3/10 can also be written as 30/100 and 7/10 can be written as 70/100.</li>
    <li>Since 3/10 can also be written as 300/1000 and 7/10 can be written as 700/1000, there can be numbers 301/1000 to 699/1000.</li>
    <li>And so on.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Between any 2 numbers, it is not necessary that there will be an integer or a whole number but there is always a rational number.</p>
    <p>Example, there are no integer or whole or natural numbers between 1 and 2, but there are rational numbers like, 1/2, 1/3 and 2/3, 1/4, 2/4, 3/4 etc.</p>
