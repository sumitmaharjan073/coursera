                <p><strong><u>Algebraic Equations and Solutions</u></strong></p>
                <p>An <strong>algebraic equation</strong> is an equality involving variables. The expression on the left of equality is called <strong>LHS (Left Hand Side)</strong> and on the right is called <strong>RHS (Right Hand Side)</strong>.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>From the above example, an algebraic equation is 2x + 20 = 40, where x is variable. Here 2x + 20 is LHS and 40 is RHS.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A <strong>Solution</strong> is the true value of the variables in the algebraic equations for which the equation holds true and LHS is equal to RHS.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>From the above example, algebraic equation is 2x + 20 = 40.
                <ul>
                <li>For x = 10, 2 * 10 + 20 = 40. Or, 40 = 40. Since LHS = RHS, hence x = 10 is the solution.</li>
                <li>For x = 5, 2 * 5 + 20 = 40.Or, 30 = 40. Since LHS &ne; RHS, hence x = 5 is not the solution.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                </ul>
