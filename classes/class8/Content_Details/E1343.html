    <p><strong><u>Good and Poor conductors of Electricity</u></strong></p>
<p>Here we try to understand whether some commonly used <strong>liquids</strong> are good or poor conductors of electricity.</p>
<p>The free ends of <strong>'Tester Using Magnetic Compass'</strong> is dipped in a beaker containing the solution under test. If the solution is a <strong>good conductor of electricity</strong>, the magnetic needle <strong>deflects</strong>. If the solution is a <strong>bad conductor of electricity</strong>, the magnetic needle does not <strong>deflect</strong>. (Alternately, we could use the LED tester too)</p>

<p>Note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>For any <strong>solution to conduct, you need ions or free electrons</strong>.</li>
<li>Pure water does not conduct electricity, but naturally occurring water (rain water, tap water etc) contain salts (ions) dissolved in it and this makes it a good conductor of electricity</li>
<li>Soda compounds (a common name for chemicals mostly containing sodium) contain ions when dissolved in water and ions help conduct electricity.</li>
<li>Milk is a good conductor of electricity because it contains water and lactic acids and other salts.</li>
<li>Honey is a solution of sugars. So, it does not conduct because it does not have ions or charged particles.</li>
</ul>
