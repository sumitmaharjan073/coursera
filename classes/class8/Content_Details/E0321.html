                <p><strong><u>Introduction to Linear Equations</u></strong></p>
                <p>A <strong>linear equation</strong> is an algebraic equation in which each term is either a constant or the product of a constant and a variable. This variable is always single power form. A simple example of a linear equation with only one variable, x, may be written in the form: ax + b = 0, where a and b are constants and a &ne; 0.</p>
                <p>These equations are called <strong>Linear Equations in one variable</strong>. Examples:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>2x</li>
                <li>5/4 (x-4)</li>
                <li>3y-7</li>
                <li>x<sup>2</sup> + 1 is an non-linear as the variable has power more than 1.</li>
                <li>5xy + 10 is not a linear equation in one variable as there are two variables</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For example, if a child has 2 chocolates of 10 rupees and a 20 rupee note, the total value can be calculated using the equation 2x + 20 = 2 * 10 + 20 = 40. Here &lsquo;x&rsquo; is variable and is the value of the chocolate.</p>

                <p>Another example, one child buys three toys (costing rupees 20 each) from a shopkeeper but gives only 5 rupees to him. The total value of items with child will be 3y - 5, where y is the cost of one toy.</p>
