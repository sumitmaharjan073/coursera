<h3>Introduction to Rational Numbers</h3>
        <p>A number which can be written in the form of p/q, where p and q are integers and q â‰ 0 is called a <strong>rational number</strong>. Numbers written in fraction are rational numbers.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>-2/3</li>
            <li>6/7</li>
            <li>-3/1</li>
            <li>4/0 is an undefined number and hence not a rational number.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, if there are 10 chocolates to be divided into 4 children, it is not possible to give 3 complete chocolates to each one of them. But, if 2 chocolatesare halved, then there will be 4half pieces and 8 full pieces of the chocolates. So each child would get 2 full pieces and 1 half piece</p>
