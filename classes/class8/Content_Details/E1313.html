    <h3> Forces are due to an interaction </h3>
    <p>As we can see in all of the above cases, <strong>2 or more objects must interact for force to come into play</strong>. Eg 1: In the case of man pulling his luggage trolley, there is an interaction between the man and his trolley. The man is applying a <strong>'push'</strong> on his trolley to make it move forward. Eg 2: In the case of the crane pulling the object, there is an interaction between the crane and the object. The crane is applying force of the object to <strong>pull</strong> it up.</p>
