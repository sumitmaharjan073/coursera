    <p><strong><u>Applications of Electroplating</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Artificial jewelry</strong>, usually made of less expensive metals is often plated with a thin layer of a precious metal like <strong>gold and silver</strong> to make it more lustrous, appealing but cheaper.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Many industrial applications</strong> use electroplating to create a protective barrier on a metal substrate. The protective barrier in this case <strong>prevents tarnishing and gives a glossy appearance</strong>. Eg: <strong>Chromium plating</strong> is done on car spare parts, taps, wheel rims etc. Chromium is very expensive and the whole part cannot be made of chromium. So, it is coated with chromium to give it a shiny appearance.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Tinning (electroplating of tin)</strong> is a very cost-effective electroplating solution. Tin is relatively cheaper&nbsp; and is used for electroplating <strong>electronic components, hardware products, fasteners, screws, nuts, bolts and food cans</strong>. If food is stored in iron cans, it would tend to get spoilt over a period of time. But, when iron is electroplated with tin, it prevents the food from getting spoilt. Tinning offers resistance against corrosion</li>

<li><strong>Zinc electroplating</strong> offers excellent adhesion and resistance to corrosion. So, it is used to <strong>electroplate automobile parts and body, transmission components, defense carriers and tanks</strong>.</li>
