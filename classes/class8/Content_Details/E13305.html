<p>The shape of our outer ear is like a <strong>funnel</strong>. Sound waves enters inside. It travels down a canal and at the end of it, touches a thin stretched membrane called the <strong>eardrum</strong>. The eardrum vibrates to the effect of the sound. The ear passes on these vibrations to the <strong>inner ear</strong> and then there to the <strong>brain</strong>, which processes it. That is how we hear.!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To understand better, take a toy drum. Bang on diaphragm with various intensity blows. First strike gently with your hands. Then blow slightly harder with the cords. Then very hard on so. In all the cases, see the diaphragm vibrates according to the intensity of the blow and then it produces the sound. This is analogous to the ear.</p>
