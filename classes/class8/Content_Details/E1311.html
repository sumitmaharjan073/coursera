    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>In our daily life, we apply force on many objects, due to which the objects change their position or shape. Eg : When a football is kicked, it moves. When we throw a smash a fully inflated balloon in between our palms, it breaks. When a cricket fielder catches the ball, it stops. A man cycling. In this chapter, we will study about force and its characteristics.</p>
