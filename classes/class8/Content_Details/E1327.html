    <p>Fluids (means liquids and gases) too&nbsp; exert friction on the objects. The frictional force exerted by fluids is called a <strong>drag</strong>. Since water and air too exert friction on the bodies that move in them like the boat, fishes (in water), aeroplane&nbsp; and birds, their physical structure should be such that they can oppose this friction and move forward.</p>
<p>Notice the similarities between the physical structure of an aeroplane (man-made) and that of an bird and also a boat(man-made) and that of a fish.</p>
