    <p><strong>Sound</strong> is produced by a <strong>vibrating body</strong>. In other words, any vibrating body would always produce sound. Sometimes, the vibration is clearly visible and the sound is strong, whereas in some cases, the vibration is small and the sound is feeble. (Note : The to and fro or back and forth motion of a body is termed as <strong>vibration or oscillatory motion</strong>). When the diaphragm of a drum is struck, it vibrates and produces sound. When the strings in a violin vibrates, it produces sound. When the air column vibrates within a flute, it produces sound. As seen, <strong>different parts</strong> of the musical instruments (diaphragm of the drum, strings of violin, air column within in flute) vibrate to produce sound.</p>
