<p>From the above figures, we can understand the following <strong>characteristics of Force</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Force has both magnitude and direction.
<ul>
<li>Case (i) Magnitude of forces : F1,F2, Direction of forces: Left to Right (---&gt;)</li>
<li>Case(ii) Magnitude of forces applied: F1,F2.<br> Direction of force F1 is Left to Right (---&gt;). <br> Direction of Force F2 is Right to Left (&lt;---)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>More than one force can be applied on an object.</li>
<li>Forces applied in the same direction add up to each other.</li>
<li>If forces are applied in the same direction, the total force adds up in the same direction. In case(i), forces are applied in the same direction. So the total force applied on the 'Heavy Object' is F1+F2 towards Right (---&gt;)</li>
<li>If forces are applied in the opposite direction, then the net force acting on the object is the difference between the forces and the object tends to move in the direction of the greater force.
<ul>
<li>In case(ii),If F1=F2, the net force on the object is F = F1-F2=0. The object does not move in any direction.</li>
<li>If F1&gt;F2, the net force on the object is F = F1-F2. The object moves in the direction of F1 ie towards Right (---&gt;)</li>
<li>If F2&gt;F1, the net force on the object is F = F2-F1. The object moves in the direction of F2 ie towards Left(&lt;---)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the magnitude or direction of the force changes, its effect also changes.</li>
</ul>
