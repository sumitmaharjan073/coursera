    <p><strong><u>Chemical Effects of Electric Current</u></strong></p>
<p>We have understood from previous classes that electric current produces many effects (heating, magnetic etc). Here we will explore what happens when electricity flows through a conducting solution.</p>
<p><strong><u><br> <img src="img/814cur1.jpg" alt="" width="439" height="227"></u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Experiment</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Take <strong>2 carbon rods</strong> from two discarded cells. (These 2 rods are called as <strong>electrodes</strong>.)</li>
<li>Clean their metal caps. Wipe them dry.</li>
<li>Tie <strong>copper wires</strong> around the metal caps of the carbon rods.</li>
<li>Join the ends of the copper wires to a battery as shown</li>
<li>Take a <strong>solution which is a good conductor of electricity</strong> (tap water, lemon juice) Immerse the rods in the solution such that the metal caps are outside the water.</li>
<li>Now the circuit is complete. Wait for about 5 minutes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Observation</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bubbles</strong> are observed near the electrodes when current passes through them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Analysis</u></strong></p>
<p>The above changes are seen due to the <strong>Chemical Effects of Electric Current</strong>. The passage of electric current through a conduction solution causes one or any of the following reactions depending on the solution and electrode &nbsp;used</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bubbles of gas</strong> are seen on the electrodes.</li>
<li><strong>Metal deposits</strong> can be seen on the electrodes</li>
</ul>
<p>The solution could change <strong>colors</strong></p>
